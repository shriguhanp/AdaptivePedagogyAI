# AdaptiveX 🚀  
### AI-Driven Multi-Agent Adaptive Pedagogy Platform

AdaptiveX is an **AI-powered adaptive learning platform** designed to solve the problem of one-size-fits-all education.  
It personalizes learning content, pace, and assessments in real time based on individual learner behavior and performance.

Built as part of **Problem Statement EDU001 – AI-Driven Adaptive Pedagogy Engine**, AdaptiveX focuses on *how students learn*, not just *what they learn*.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Traditional education platforms deliver the same content to all learners, ignoring differences in:
- Learning speed  
- Understanding level  
- Learning style  

This results in:
- Poor learning outcomes  
- Reduced engagement  
- Increased academic stress  
- Limited teacher bandwidth  

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**AdaptiveX** introduces a **multi-agent AI pedagogy engine** that dynamically adapts learning for every student.

Instead of static courses, AdaptiveX:
- Understands learner performance and behavior
- Adjusts difficulty, pace, and explanations
- Generates personalized assessments
- Maintains learning memory across sessions

Each learner follows a **unique, evolving learning path**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

AdaptiveX follows a layered architecture:

1. **User Interaction Layer** – Student queries and structured responses  
2. **Agent Intelligence Layer** – Multi-agent collaboration  
3. **Tool Layer** – RAG, web search, code execution, document parsing  
4. **Knowledge & Memory Layer** – Vector embeddings, knowledge graphs, session memory  

This design enables scalable and explainable adaptive learning.
